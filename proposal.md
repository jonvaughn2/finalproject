# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Jon's Racer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game built using pygame that will allow a player to race against themselves, with the objective being to beat your previous time

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will allow the player to race to beat their own best time, allow the player to view their own best time. It will have the player use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the vehicle around(forward, back, steer-right/left). It will be executed using pygame.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for the project would be for me to at least create something that allows the user to drive around on a track

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be for me to be able to display/record the users best times for completing the race

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome would be if the user could select the amount of laps that they will drive for, and to have a "best lap" feature

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to review all the content we covered in class, and to learn a lot of things about using pygame that I will need to combine with that content from class in order to reach my goals.
