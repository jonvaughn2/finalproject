Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have succeeded in creating a pygame window,
set the background color to a grey color. I have also put grass
on the sides of the track, and added yellow strips for lanes.
I've also added restrictions to where the car image can be

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I need to implement a start menu, other cars on the road.
I also need a pause menu, and need to add code to end the race when the car crashes.
Also I need to display the score on the screen.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I realized that my idea of a race around a track idea would be a little too complex,
so I've decided to take a more linear approach. I'm making one of those games
where you are driving in a straight line and must avoid other cars that you are passing
(think subway surfers, but top down, and no jumping)
I haven't had any trouble yet, but i suspect that enabling the car to move with the keys, as well as implementing crash
logic will be my biggest ones.
