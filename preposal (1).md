# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
  Gunfight 2D - a top down shooter in which 2 players start at opposite ends of a rectangular map. The map will need obstacles for players to get behind to avoid
  being hit. Each time a player eliminates the other, they win a round, which they need three of to win the match. I'm also thinking of having a timer for each round, and
  if both players are still alive at the end of the timer, the round will be a draw. I'm not sure how difficult it will be but maybe I will add a overtime flag in the middle of  the map.
  
  Racing Game -
  A top down racing game in which you try and beat your own lap times. Maybe achieving certain lap times will result in new vehicles becoming available. the new vehicles will have different stats when it comes to speed, and acceleration.
  
  Alarm Clock - 
  Create an alarm clock that can be used to track sleep as well.
  
  


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am working solo on this project

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Do any of these seem like they will be too difficult or too simple for someone who has only the python experience from your class?
